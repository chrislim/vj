### Code
This is a simple function that translates the logic of the visitation hour rules into a human readable form.
After making changes to visitJojo.js, run `browserify index.js -o vj.js` to get a new build.
Eventually we can migrate to webpack and best practices. This is to get something out the door.

Just a fun little profile/card-style template I whipped up during a break between major
projects. Minimal, responsive, and powered by Responsive Tools + Sass. Enjoy :)
